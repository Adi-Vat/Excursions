# ASCII Graph Viewer

A 2D graph viewer written in C.  
The hard-coded function is evaluated for the bounds of the screen. The user can navigate around the graph and zoom in/out.  
There's some information about the selected point at the top of the screen; the (x,y) coordinate, and the approximate derivative at that point.

## To Do
- Add support for multiple graphs.
- Add equation parser (probably coming in a seperate project).
- Add support for 3D graphs by moving through 2D slices.
