# Haptic Sim 2D
## Overview
A force-based softbody simulation with cutting. Eventually, the C# app will be interfaced with a custom torque joystick.  
The force shown as a white line on the screen will be applied to the joystick to prevent the user from pushing further.  
This design could then be scaled up to a kinematic controller that allows the user to move a pointer in 3 axes, and translate into a VR space.
